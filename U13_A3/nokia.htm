<p>
  The Nokia X series, launched in 2014, featured a range of budget-friendly smartphones built <br> 
  with durable materials and a unique design. The phones ran a custom Android-based <br> 
  operating system, which was a modified version of Android with a Windows Phone-style <br> 
  interface. The devices included a 4-inch to 5-inch display, depending on the model, <br> 
  with a resolution of 480 x 800 pixels. The X series typically featured a Qualcomm <br> 
  Snapdragon processor, with 512MB to 1GB of RAM and 4GB to 8GB of internal storage, <br> 
  expandable via microSD. The cameras ranged from 3MP to 5MP, depending on the model, <br> 
  with basic photography capabilities. The phones supported 3G connectivity, Wi-Fi, <br> 
  Bluetooth, and had a removable 1500mAh to 2000mAh battery, offering decent performance <br> 
  for everyday tasks. Despite its innovative approach with Android apps and Nokiaâ€™s <br> 
  signature build quality, the X series was eventually phased out, marking a brief yet <br> 
  distinctive chapter in Nokia's mobile history.
